# UNIT 4 â€“ Wireframe Design for a Generic Application

## AIM
To design low-fidelity wireframes for a generic application or website using Balsamiq, covering five essential screens while focusing on layout structure, navigation flow, and UI element placement.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Creating a visual blueprint of a digital product is critical before diving into high-fidelity design and development. This experiment aims to build foundational wireframes using Balsamiq to define structure, user flow, and usability for a generic application, without involving colors or detailed graphics.

## NAVIGATION FLOW

- Navigation should use clearly marked buttons or icons.
- Users should be able to move back and forth between screens easily.

---

## DESIGN GUIDELINES

- Keep designs grayscale and low-fidelity (no colors or graphics)
- Use standard Balsamiq elements: rectangles, labels, icons
- Apply proper alignment, spacing, and grouping
- Use font size to differentiate titles, labels, and input hints

---

## TOOLS USED

- **Balsamiq Wireframes**
- Export format: PNG or BMPR

---

## OBSERVATIONS

| Screen         | Key UI Elements                     | Navigation Method     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Splash         | Logo, App Name, Start Button         | Tap to Login           |
| Login/Signup   | Input fields, Buttons, Social login  | Submit credentials     |

## RESULTS

Five wireframes were successfully created using Balsamiq for a generic e-commerce application. The designs effectively define structure, flow, and UI positioning, ensuring clarity in the user journey.

---

## CONCLUSION

This wireframing activity demonstrates how early-stage design can lay the foundation for usability and functionality. The low-fidelity wireframes provide a visual structure for interface planning and user-centered development.
